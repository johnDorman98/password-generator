## Welcome to my Java Project Management Program. üëã 
This project will be my first version of a password generator. It will act as the skeleton for a larger project where I will add additional features such as a GUI and different passwrod generator features.

## Features 
* This program lets the user decide how many letters, symbols, and numbers they wish to have in their password.
* The program will display an unshuffled and shuffled version of the password.
* The user will be asked if they wish to generate a new password. If so, it will ask them to enter the required inputs.

## Installation 
* In order for this program to work, you will need two main things. The first is Python installed on your computer, and the second is an IDE to run the program.
* Below is a link that will take you through the setup and installation for Python.
  
    [Python installation link](https://medium.com/co-learning-lounge/how-to-download-install-python-on-windows-2021-44a707994013)

* Now that you have confirmed that Python is installed and working, we can download the program and run it. In order to download the zip file for the program, you can click on the download button below.

    [Download Project](https://github.com/johnDorman98/password-generator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

* In this case, you can choose to extract it where you wish to. Once it has been extracted, open the folder and you will see a file named "password_generator.py". If you double click on it, you will get a popup asking what you want to run it with. In this case, choose Python.
  * Afterwards, a console window will popup asking you for your input. Congratulations, you have gotten Python installed and managed to run the program successfully.

## Usage  
The first version of the password generator is simple, so you can at this moment enter the number of letters, symbols, or numbers you desire to generate. Below is an image to give you an example of how the program works.

As you can see above, the program has generated a random password based on the number of letters, symbols, and numbers I selected.
